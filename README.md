`-` is a very accepting programming language. It is object-oriented, stack-based, _and_ strip-based! The three core commands are these: 
* `O` - switch to object oriented mode
* `S` - switch to stack based mode
* `T` - switch to strip-based mode

These commands are always accessible:
* `[` - increase loop depth
* `]` - decrease loop depth if and only if the byte is nonzero. If the depth is the same, jumps back to the matching bracket of the same depth level.
